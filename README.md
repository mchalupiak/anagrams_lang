# anagrams_lang
## **Be aware that using a long string of letters (ex: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz) will take a significant amount of time!**
The same code for generating anagrams, written in several different languages to compare performance

Run the Ruby with `./anagrams.rb [letters]` on unix/macos; `ruby .\anagrams.rb [letters]` for windows  
Run the Python with `./anagrams.py [letters]` on unix/macos; `python .\anagrams.py [letters]` for windows  
Run the Rust by first compiling with `rustc -C opt-level=3 anagrams.rs` and then `./anagrams [letters]` on unix/macos or `.\anagrams [letters]` for windows  
The C version currently does not work  
**Make sure you have the respective runtime installed for whatever language you are trying to run; ex: install ruby to run the ruby version or python to run the python version. The website for each language will have instuctions on how to do this for your platform**
